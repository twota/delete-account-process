"Delete an Account"


To permanently delete your account and all associated data, go to the "Profile" tab, navigate to the "Account" page, and select "Delete Account". If you signed up using an email address, you will need to confirm your identity by entering your password and answering a brief question about whether you found a partner through the app. Once confirmed, your profile will be completely removed.
